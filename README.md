# Solar-Radiation-Prediction

Overview: 
This project aims to predict solar radiation levels using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Accurate prediction of solar radiation is crucial for optimizing the performance and efficiency of solar power systems. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to forecast solar radiation based on historical weather data.

Features: 
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training.
LSTM Model: Implementation of an LSTM neural network for time series prediction.
Training and Evaluation: Training the model on historical data and evaluating its performance.
Visualization: Graphical representation of the predicted vs actual solar radiation levels.

Dataset: 
The dataset used for this project includes historical weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and past solar radiation measurements. It is sourced from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dronio/SolarEnergy/data" . The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and structure it for time series analysis.

Results: 
The LSTM model demonstrates good performance in predicting solar radiation levels, with evaluation metrics indicating its accuracy and reliability. Below are some sample visualizations of the predicted vs actual solar radiation:
